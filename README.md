Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the process of maintaining software by developing,testing and designing it.Software Engineers use various tools and methodologies, such as Agile and Scrum project management to ensure that software is developed efficiently and effectively.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the systematic approach to the development, designing and maintenace of software by applying well-defined principlesand procedures to deliver efficient and reliable software.
The main difference between software engineering and traditional programming is that software engineering is a process-oriented discipline that uses structured processes that involves software development while traditional programming is centered around writing code to solve specific problems or perform certain operations.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The Software Development Life Cycle consists of seven main phases.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1.Planning
This phase involves defining the objectives,purpose and scope in a team.The team collaborates to understand the end-users needs and the goals the software should meet
2.Requirements Analysis
In this phase, the team analyzes the clients's goals or product and decides on the features to aim for as a final goal.Defining and establishing requirements determines what application will do once launched,the necessary compenents and resources needed to launch it.
3.Design and Prototype
During this phase, developers design the software architecture,user-interface,security measures and programming tools.Prototyping is also part of this phase,allowing customers to get a sneak peek of how there application will look like and provide feedback.
4.Coding or Implementation
Developers start programming and translating the design into a computer-legible language
The tasks are divided into modules and assigned to various developers.Predefined coding guidelines are used and programming tools to implement the code.
5.Testing
The developed software is tested to ensure it works according to the customer requirements.The testing team tests the functionality of the entire system.If bugs or defects are found they are communicated to the developers, who fix them and send it back for retesting until the software is stable and bug-free.
6.Deployment
Once the testing is done the software is released to customers to use. The size of the project determines the complexity of the deployment. Users are provided with training or documentation to help them operate software.
7.Maintenance
In this phase,the developed product is maintained and updated based on changing user requirements or technology.The product is updated timely to ensure it continues to meet the needs of the users.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is a principle where a software system is divided into separate, self-contained units called modules. Each module encapsulates a specific piece of functionality and has well-defined interfaces for interacting with other modules.
Benefits of Modularity
1.improved Maintainability:
Isolation of Changes: Changes in one module have minimal impact on others, making it easier to understand, fix, and enhance individual parts of the system.
Simplified Testing: Modules can be tested independently, facilitating unit testing and reducing the scope of debugging when issues arise.
2.Enhanced Scalability:
Parallel Development: Different teams can work on different modules simultaneously without interfering with each other, accelerating development cycles.
Load Distribution: In distributed systems, modules can be deployed across multiple servers, allowing the system to handle more users and requests by adding resources where needed.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Levels of Software Testing
1.Unit Testing:
Scope: Tests individual components or functions.
Objective: Ensure each unit performs as expected.
Tools: JUnit, NUnit, pytest.
Responsibility: Typically done by developers.
2.Integration Testing:
Scope: Tests interactions between integrated units/modules.
Objective: Ensure combined units work together correctly.
Types: Top-down, bottom-up, sandwich (hybrid).
Responsibility: Developers or a dedicated QA team.
3.System Testing:
Scope: Tests the complete integrated system.
Objective: Validate the system against requirements.
